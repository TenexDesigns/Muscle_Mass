Sure, when used appropriately, dietary supplements can play a critical role in helping you achieve your fitness goals.
Heres a guideline on how you can take the mentioned supplements for optimal muscle growth:


Mass Gainers:
 These generally contain a high amount of carbohydrates and proteins. You should consume mass gainers after your workout session.
The carbohydrates help in replenishing your body's glycogen stores, and the protein helps in muscle recovery and growth.

Protein Supplements: 
Proteins are the building blocks for muscle repair and growth. 
 They can be taken both before and after workouts. A smaller portion before your workout can provide your muscles with
a source of amino acids to prevent muscle protein breakdown during your exercise session. Taking protein post-workout helps to aid in muscle recovery and growth.

Creatine: This supplement is usually consumed pre-workout.
It helps in increasing your muscles phosphocreatine stores which can produce more energy during high-intensity workouts,
thereby improving overall workout performance. It can also be beneficial post-workout as it enhances muscle repair and increases muscle protein synthesis.

Beta-Alanine: This is generally taken pre-workout. It increases carnosine levels in your muscles which reduces acidity during high-intensity exercise.
This delay in muscle fatigue can enhance your overall workout performance and enable you to train longer and harder.

Fish Oil: Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil can be taken at any time of the day.
 The omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties that can help to increase your muscles' sensitivity to protein and further support protein synthesis.

Its essential to remember these three key points:

1. Make sure to follow the recommended dosages on the packaging to avoid potential side effects.                                                            
2. Its always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.                                                          
3. These supplements should be used as part of a balanced diet and consistent workout routine for the best results.
